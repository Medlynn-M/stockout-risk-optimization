## üöÄ Project Overview

Retail stockouts cause lost sales and dissatisfied customers. This project builds an AI-driven predictive framework to classify products by stockout risk using historical sales, inventory, promotions, weather, and competitor pricing data.

The main highlights include:

- Extensive exploratory data analysis to understand demand patterns and inventory dynamics.
- Data preprocessing, feature engineering, and balancing with SMOTE to tackle class imbalance.
- Comparison of multiple classification models with hyperparameter tuning.
- Selection of XGBoost as the best-performing model based on recall, F1-score, and ROC AUC.
- Strategic business recommendations for dynamic inventory replenishment and supply chain improvements.

## üí° Key Features

- Predict stockout risk accurately to minimize lost revenue.
- Incorporate external factors like weather, holidays, and competitor pricing.
- Balance precision and recall for operationally viable predictions.
- Provide actionable recommendations to retail decision-makers.
- Interactive chatbot to simulate smarter inventory queries.
